# Conflicting Car Accessibility Check 

This check flags roads that have conflicting highway, transportation and access tags. A conflict in these tags occurs when any of the below conditions is met:
 * A car-navigable highway tag value combined with a restrictive car 
access tag value with no designated vehicle tags 
 * A non-car navigable highway tag value combined with an open car access tag value
 * A car-navigable highway tag value combined with `Access`=`YES` tag and with designated vehicle tags like `Motorcycle`,`Bus` etc.
#### Live Examples
1. The way [id:27605010](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27605010) has conflicting values between highway tag (highway=PATH) and motorcar tag values (motorcar=YES), which allows a car to drive. Normally, highway=PATH represents no access for cars and this tag combination is an example for non-car navigable highway with car access.
2. The way [id:409750479](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/409750479) has conflicting values between highway tag (highway=SERVICE) and motorcar tag values (motorcar=NO), which prohibits cars to drive. The only transportation that is allowed here is the motorcycle which makes it a designated highway and so the access tag value should have been equal to NO instead of YES.
3. The way [id:369590090](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/369590090) has conflicting values between highway tag (highway=RESIDENTIAL) and vehicle tag values (vehicle=NO), which prohibits cars to drive. It has bicycle=DESIGNATED tag to allow bicycles to use this road segment, which is conflicting with the highway tag value.
    
#### Code Review
In [Atlas](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas), OSM elements are represented as Edges, Points, Lines, Nodes & Relations; in our case, weâ€™re are looking at [Edges](https://github.com/osmlab/atlas/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/openstreetmap/atlas/geography/atlas/items/Edge.java).
Our first goal is to validate the incoming Atlas object. Valid features for this check will satisfy the following conditions:
* Is an Edge
* Has a `Highway` tag
* `AccessTag` for the object is not "no"
* Has either `MotorVehicleTag` or `MotorcarTag` or `VehicleTag`
* Does not contain any conditional tags such as `motor_vehicle:conditional`, `vehicle:conditional` or `motorcar:conditional` tags
* Is a master edge
* Is not an OSM way that has already been flagged

The valid objects are then checked for car accessibility and designated vehicle tags. A helper method validates if an `AtlasObject` is car accessible or not. Car accessibility is determined by the three transportation tags - `MotorcarTag`,`MotorVehicleTag` and `VehicleTag`. If any one of the above is present, the tag's value will determine the car accessibility. The check for 
the tag is based on the hierarchy - `MotorcarTag` -> `MotorVehicleTag` -> `VehicleTag`. If the object 
meets any of the three conditions mentioned above for a conflict to  occur, it will be flagged. Designated vehicle tags can be given in the config file; if not specified, default set of tags in the source code will be considered for the check.
